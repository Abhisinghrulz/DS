**Stack** is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out)

**Stack as Array**

Pros: Easy to implement. Memory is saved as pointers are not involved.
Cons: It is not dynamic. It doesnâ€™t grow and shrink depending on needs at runtime.

**Stack as LinkedList**

Pros: The linked list implementation of stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.
Cons: Requires extra memory due to involvement of pointers.
