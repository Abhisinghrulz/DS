Adding a room is horizontal scaling

Moving to a bigger room is vertical scaling

Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources. Eg. As traffic goes up you add more web servers to take on the traffic.

Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

If your application is able to handle different ranges of traffic  it is called scalable

Scale Up : To handle increasing request

Scale Down : To reduce cost

Scaling means the ability to handle increase or decrease in growth, demand or work by a system. 

Vertical scaling is the adding of extra power, memory etc to an existing machine. Horizontal scaling means adding extra machines to a system to handle the increase in load. 

Horizontal scaling is also known as scale-out. In horizontal scaling, we add more machines and set it up as a cluster of machines to handle the increase or decrease in requirements.
