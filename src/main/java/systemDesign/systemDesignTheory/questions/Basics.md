Bandwidth looks at the amount of data being transferred while latency looks at the amount of time it takes data to transfer. These two terms come together as throughput, which refers to the amount of data that is being transferred over a set period of time

Bandwidth is a measure of how much data over time a communication link can handle, its capacity. This is typically measured as kbps (kilobits – thousands of bits per second), Mbps (megabits – millions of bits per second) or Gbps (gigabits – billions of bits per second).

Latency is the time it takes for a packet to get across the network, from source to destination. It is measured in units of time — ms (millisecond, or 1/1,000 of a second).

Throughput is the actual amount of data that is successfully sent/received over the communication link. Throughput is presented as kbps, Mbps or Gbps, and can differ from bandwidth due to a range of technical issues, including latency, packet loss, jitter and more.
