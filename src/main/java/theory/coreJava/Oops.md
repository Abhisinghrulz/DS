OOPS Concepts and its implementation in Java
1. OOP.
2. Principles of OOP.
3. Open closed principle.
4. Difference between object oriented and object based language.
5. Define class.
6. Object.
7. Define a variable/data.
8. Explain Diamond problem.
9. SOLID principles of OOD (Object Oriented Design).
```
Dependency Inversion Principle
The principle states:
A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

10. Why Java does not support operator overloading?
11. Differences Between Static Binding And Dynamic Binding In Java.
12. In a class, a method is overloaded and One form is declared static while another form is non-static. Is that method properly overloaded?
13. What is Encapsulation in Java?
14. Difference between data hiding and data abstraction in OOPS.
15. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation in OOPS.
16. Which of the Java OOPS feature promotes access protection or data hiding?
17. Explain Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

`Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
`    
18. Explain cohesion and coupling in OOD.
