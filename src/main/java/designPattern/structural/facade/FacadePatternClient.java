/**
 *
 A Facade Pattern says that just "just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client".

 In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

 Practically, every Abstract Factory is a type of Facade.
